# **Uttarakhand Adventure Website**

Live Demo: https://anisha992.github.io/Uttarakhand-Adventure-Website/

Welcome! This website is my personal journey into creating something exciting, showcasing the stunning beauty of Uttarakhand’s landscapes and heritage. From hill stations to temples, I’ve tried to capture the magic of these spots while also learning and experimenting with HTML and CSS along the way. Hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I had fun making it!

## **What’s Inside?**
- Explore Amazing Places: I've made pages for different destinations like Almora, Auli, Nainital, Rishikesh, and more. Each page has details and pics of these places.
- Sign Up/Login: You can even sign up, log in, and save your favorite spots.

## **What I Learned**
This project was more of an experiment for me to get better with HTML and CSS. While making the website, I figured out how to:

- Create a navigation bar (so people can easily find their way around the site).
- Style it up with CSS to make things look clean and neat.
- Use images to show off the beauty of Uttarakhand.
- And most importantly, I learned how to have fun while coding and making something useful!

## **Tools I Played With**
1. HTML: To build the basic structure of the website.
2. CSS: To make it look pretty and stylish.
